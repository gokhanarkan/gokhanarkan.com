So, as you know, I maintain a personal website to showcase my work and share my thoughts with the world. For many years, I used Next.js to power my landing page gokhanarkan.com. However, recently I made the switch to Hugo and I want to share with you why I made this decision.

Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed using Next.js. Its server-side rendering capabilities allowed me to create a fast and responsive website that was great for SEO. The framework's flexibility also allowed me to create complex web applications with ease.

However, as my needs changed, I found that Next.js was becoming a bit too complex for my simple landing page. I didn't need all the features that came with the framework and I wanted something simpler and easier to maintain.

That's when I discovered Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator that is designed for simplicity and speed. It allows you to create a website quickly and easily, without the overhead of a more complex framework. Since it generates static HTML pages, it's faster and more reliable than dynamic websites.

One of the main benefits of Hugo over Next.js is how simple it is to set up and use. With Hugo, all I had to do was create a template and write my content in Markdown, and Hugo took care of the rest.

Another advantage of Hugo is its speed. Since it generates static HTML pages, there is no need to worry about server-side rendering or complex JavaScript code. The pages load quickly, which is great for SEO and user experience.

Finally, one of the reasons I switched to Hugo is its ease of maintenance. With Next.js, I had to worry about updates, security patches, and much more. With Hugo, all I have to do is write my content and publish it. Since it generates static HTML pages, there is no need to worry about server maintenance or database backups.

To conclude, while I enjoyed using Next.js for many years, I found it was becoming too complex for my simple landing page. Hugo is a simpler and faster option that is easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to maintain. If you're looking for a simple and reliable static site generator, I highly recommend giving Hugo a try.

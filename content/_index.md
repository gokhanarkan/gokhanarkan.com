I am a software engineer based in London, and I study
part-time towards my Master's degree at the University of Oxford.

I like video-games, listening or creating music, cycling, and
photography. In fact, I'll be glad to accept invitations as a
volunteer photographer for charity/community.

Although I am not actively using social media, please feel free to
email me at <a className="link" href="mailto:gokhan@hey.com"> gokhan@hey.com </a> if you have any enquiries.

If you are unreasonable enough; you can
<a href="https://post.arkan.me">
send me a POST request</a> too.

I am a software engineer based in London, UK 🇬🇧, originally from Istanbul, Türkiye 🇹🇷.

I am working as one of the founding engineers for a company called [Surfe](https://www.surfe.com) since 2021 which is based in Paris, France 🇫🇷.

Aside from my work, I also study part-time towards my Master's degree at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) 🇬🇧.

My interests include programming, video-games, cycling, and tennis. I am also a passionate photography enthusiast and would gladly accept invitations to volunteer as a photographer for charitable organizations.
